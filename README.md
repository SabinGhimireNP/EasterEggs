## Secret Word Detector with Cornify.js

This project was a small one but may be useful in the future when I create my own proper portfolio website. Todayâ€™s project consists of some code that detects the characters/keys entered by the user and then performs an action when the entered word matches the set secret word.

For this project, the secret word is **sabin** (all in lowercase), which will add an element from `cornify.js`, one of the popular JavaScript libraries that adds rainbow ðŸŒˆ and unicorn ðŸ¦„ components to the webpage.
